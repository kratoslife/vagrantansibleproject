On this page you can find my Vagrant Ansible Project. Some code are finding on the web and edited by me, on this project Vagrant will create 2 VM's on VirtualBox from script and this VM's will contain Apache HTTP server with Java application on it and second monitor VM with Zabbix which will look at first VM to monitor everything. Its only a sample how to create automated environment, only problem what I found is Ansible its not working on Windows - pip errors. I've used CentOS 7 as host machine.
